To get the secret word when creating a lobby, you need to make a POST request to the `/lobby` endpoint.
You no longer need to provide a `secret_word` in the request body. The server will generate one for you based on the selected difficulty.

The response will be a JSON object containing the `lobby_id` and the randomly selected `secret_word`.

Example response:
```json
{
  "lobby_id": "lobby_1234567890abcdef",
  "secret_word": "a_randomly_generated_word"
}
```

You can then store the `secret_word` locally in your mobile app.
